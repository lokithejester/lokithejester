hi!! Im most commonly known as Seven or Abel, if you're reading this it is most likely from ponytown, hello. thanks 4 coming to check out my page, hope we can b friends. ^_^

i am 15 n above, hence why I don't want people under 15 interacting with me, please interact with caution since I tend to have a lot of mood swings, as well as violent spurs. (I will warn you, if these violent spurs happen, I will mostly come off rude or I will go semi to nonverbal.)

           a few things ! !

I do not do mutuals. It feels awkward to me. 

I have NO form of OSDD, DID, system stuff.. yeah. I just simply like to refer to myself as characters I enjoy and characters I kin! thank you. (I say this because I have been mistaken a lot for a system?)

I prefer you ask to sit / cuddle / hug with me!! I will most likely move away if I do NOT know you. It makes me uncomfortable. 

I am sometimes a busy person, meaning do not expect me to immediately respond if you do message me, if I do not know you / am not that close, I might not respond or respond very little. 

I do not lend my supporter to others, plus it's t1, what's the point, people?


           SEE YOU SOON. .
